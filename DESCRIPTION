Description: The xtractomatic package contains three functions that access
    environmental data from ERD's ERDDAP service. The xtracto function extracts
    data along a trajectory for a given "radius" around the point. The
    xtracto_3D function extracts data in a box. The xtractogon function
    extracts data in a polygon. There are also two helper functions to obtain
    information about available data.
